[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/edsu/anon.png)](http://travis-ci.org/edsu/anon)

This little coffee script will watch Wikipedia for edits from a set of named
IP ranges and will tweet when it notices one.  It was inspired by [@parliamentedits](https://twitter.com/parliamentedits) and is used to make the [@congressedits](https://twitter.com/congressedits) feed available. 

The IP addesses for the Department of Parliamentary Services came from robtex: https://www.robtex.com/as/as45442.html and will be used as a stand-in pending an FOI request for an official list of IP ranges used.
